         "¾ cup chilled heavy cream, divided",
         "4 large egg yolks",
         "¼ cup brewed espresso or strong coffee, room temperature",
         "⅛ teaspoon kosher salt",

         "Beat ½ cup cream in a small bowl to stiff peaks; cover and chill.",
         "Combine egg yolks, espresso, salt, and 2 Tbsp. sugar in a heatproof bowl. Set over a saucepan of gently simmering water (do not let bowl touch water). Cook, whisking constantly, until mixture is lighter in color and almost doubled in volume and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the mixture registers 160°, about 1 minute.",

         "Just before serving, whisk remaining 1/4 cup cream in a small bowl to soft peaks; top each cup of mousse with a dollop of cream."
